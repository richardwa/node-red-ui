# node-red-ui
node-red ui only, taken from running a server and tweaked to work with only static files.  

Employed a few tricks to do this correctly
* run node-red server 
* use httrack to mirror the site offline
* some missing resources were filled in from node-red codebase
* check for errors and missing files
* tweaked javascript and filled in missing files by hand
